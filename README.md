## Program Details

This program takes a string and int input from user.

The int input encrypts the string using a caesar cipher.
A caesar cipher encrypts the plaintext by replacing every letter in the plaintext with the corresponding next letter according to the "shift" integer. Refer to [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) for more information.
